# MVC Example
This repository contains an example of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern implemented in a Java application. The MVC pattern is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.

## ClockModel
The model component represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the state of the application and for responding to requests for information from the view and the controller.

## MainClockView
The view component is responsible for displaying the data from the model to the user. It is also responsible for capturing user input and sending it to the controller for processing.

## Controller
The controller component acts as an intermediary between the view and the model. It receives user input from the view, processes it using the business logic from the model, and updates the view with the new data.

By separating an application into these three components, the MVC pattern allows for greater modularity and flexibility in software design. This example demonstrates how the pattern can be used to build a scalable and maintainable Java application.
