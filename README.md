# SimpleFXClock
This repository contains a simple JavaFX clock application that displays the current time with an option to switch between standard (12-hour) and military (24-hour) time formats. The application uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend.
